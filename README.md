# Bouncing Balls with JS + HTML5

This was an exercise from the [Mozilla JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_building_practice).
On page load, 25 random balls are created and start moving across the screen. 

This example makes use of the HTML Canvas API for drawing the balls to the screen and the requestAnimationFrame API for animating the entire display. 

Velocity based movement, collision detection.
